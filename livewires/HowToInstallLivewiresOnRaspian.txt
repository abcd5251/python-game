How to install THE LIVEWIRES PACKAGE 3.0 


Dependencies
------------
To install the livewires package, you must first install Python 3. To 
use the livewires package, you must have pygame installed. Pygame is already installed on 2017-03-02-raspian-jessie.


Installation
------------
Open the setup.py file in Idle and then run it. You should see a series of  messages such as 

running install
running build
......

If you get a message that Python can't be found, you may need to update your PATH to include the folder in which you installed Python.


Testing
-------
Start the Python interpreter and type:

from livewires import games, color

If this line produces no errors, you've successfully installed the livewires package. If you get an error that refers to pygame, you may have a version of Python that does not include pygame. Pygame is required to use livewires.
